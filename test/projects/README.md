# Student Projects

## Overview of Independent Study

<div class="post">

Like most of the Psychology faculty, I regularly involve students in my research. Students can become involved in any phase of a research project, from writing a research proposal and designing the study to analyzing and presenting the findings. Although students who want to be part of an entire project become involved on a three-semester basis, many students are involved for only a portion of a project. I typically offer two credts of PSYC 399 (Independent Study) for each semester of involvement.

## Samples of Independent Study Projects

<div class="post">

My students tend to do projects that closely align with my research interests. However, my interests have varied considerably over time and so the student projects tend to be quite varied as well. The following completed projects have been presented at the annual UWSP Letters and Science Undergraduate Research Symposium.
