### My Professional Interests

Broadly speaking, I am interested in social and cultural psychology, statistical methods, and the scholarship of teaching and learning. Of course, these interests are not mutually exclusive; in fact, most of my work spans more than one of these categories.

- **Social and Cultural Psychology:** Justice, fairness, and morality; social and political values; cultural and evolutionary psychology.
- **Statistics and Research Methods:** Confidence intervals; effect sizes; structural equation modeling; multilevel modeling.
- **Scholarship of Teaching and Learning:** Social psychology of education; student evaluations of teaching; faculty development.
