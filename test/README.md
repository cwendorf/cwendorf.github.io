### My Professional Interests

Broadly speaking, I am interested in social and cultural psychology, statistical methods, and the scholarship of teaching and learning. Of course, these interests are not mutually exclusive; in fact, most of my work spans more than one of these categories.

- **Social and Cultural Psychology:** Justice, fairness, and morality; social and political values; cultural and evolutionary psychology.
- **Statistics and Research Methods:** Confidence intervals; effect sizes; structural equation modeling; multilevel modeling.
- **Scholarship of Teaching and Learning:** Social psychology of education; student evaluations of teaching; faculty development.

### Materials on this Site

I believe in clear and open practices in higher education. All of my summary teaching materials, links to all of my research publications and student independent projects, and portals to my open source statistics resources are all available on this website.
